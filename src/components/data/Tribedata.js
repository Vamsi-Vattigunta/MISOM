            content: '-------------------------------\n1. Name and Synonym \n' + '-------------------------------' + ' \n The name `Chenchu’ was explained based on ecological, racial, cultural, historical and mythological concepts. The interpretation on the basis of land and plants depicts that a person who lives under a ‘Chettu’ (tree) is known as Chenchu (Aiyappan:1948). According to Haimendorf (1943), the racial explanation for the word `Chenchu means curly hair, which is one of the physical features of the ‘Chenchus’. Manusmrithi makes a mention of, a people called ‘Chunchu’ and were assumed that the ‘Chunchu’ was nothing but a reference to the present day Chenchus. Aiyappan (1948) says that “the name ‘Chenchu’ may be derived from Chunchu meaning, forelocks”. Chenchus are also called as Chencholu, Chenchwar, Chenswar or Choncharu.\n ' + '-------------------------------\n' + '2. Origins and History \n ' + '-------------------------------\n' + 'The origin of the Chenchus, is connected with the Lord Mallikarjuna of the Srisailam temple, who was the personification of the Lord Shiva. The story says that once their lived husband and wife in the small hut near the Srisailam temple. Both were very happy with their life, but they had no children. They paid homage at temples and worshiped many deities but all in vain. One day they went haunting into the forest. They found Lord Mallikarjuna in the forest and told him about their sorrow. Lord Mallikarjuna granted their wish on one condition that they would dedicate their child to him. Both agreed and after nine months, the women gave birth to the female child, whom she dedicated to the Lord Mallikarjuna. When the girl child was three years old, she left her parents and started living in the forests under the Chettu (tree). As she was living under the chettu tree she was called as the Chenchita. One day, while roaming in the jungle she met Lord Mallikarjuna and fell in love with him. He was also attracted to the girl and married her. The descendants are called Chenchus, which means children of the girl who was living under the cheetu (tree).\n ' + '---------------------------------------------------------\n' + '3. Demography and Population Distribution \n' + '---------------------------------------------------------\n' + '\n The Chenchus are one of the aboriginal tribes of the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. They are mostly confined to foothills and low-lying areas of Amarbad Plateau and Nallamalai hills in Kurnool, Mahaboobnagar, Prakasam, Rangareddy, Nalgonda and Guntur districts. As per the population censes taken in 2011, the population of Chenchus is 47,315. Among them 23,842 are men and 23,468 are women. Presently, the Chenchus live in permanent settlements known as gudems or Pentas comprising clusters of huts scattered over a wide area.\n\n' + '-------------------------------' + ' \n 4. Physical Features\n' + '-------------------------------' + ' \n \n Chenchus are short in height with long head, well-defined eyebrows with flat nose. They have jet-black curly hair and their complexion varies from wheat gray to brown. Chenchus have broad faces. The anthropologists observe that these chenchus have phsycal features similar to the “Veddoid” race. The word ‘veddoid’ has come from the word “Vedda” which is the name of an ancient tribe in Srilanka. Like the “veddoids” the chenchus have curly hair, wide face, snubbed nose, long jaw and dark complexion and short stature.\n 5. Dress and Ornaments \n The Chenchus no longer wear just a loincloth. They now wear the dress and ornaments like other villagers and town people.\n 6. Social Organisation \n The Chenchu tribe is divided into four local groups such as:Konda Chenchu: They are found in Kurnool and Mahabubnagar districts;Koya Chenchu: They are found concentrating in Bhadrachalam district,            Ura Chenchu: They are scattered and distributed in towns and cities and live interspersed among advanced groups;            Dasari Chenchu: They are found mainly in Kurnool district.            These groups are principally endogamous units. But the Ura and Konda Chenchu, at present, have started marrying amongst themselves.        \n                 6.1.  Clan     \n       Each of the four groups is further divided into several patrilineal, totemic, and exogamous clans. Marriage within a clan is not permissible. Prof. Haimendorf has recorded as many as 26 clans among the Chenchus.     \n       6.2. Family      \n      Nuclear, monogamous families are common in all clans. Husband, wife, and unmarried children constitute as members in an average Chenchu family. Families are patrilocal in nature. Neolocal residence is common where married sons with their wives live in separate hutments within the domicile of their father’s. Father is the head of the family while mother enjoys her supremacy in domestic affairs.      \n       6.3. Marriage      \n      Traditionally, marriage by elopement or marriage by abduction was the common practices of marriage among the Chenchus. Divorces, widow marriage, remarriage were also common. Today the Chenchus prefer the arranged marriages. The frequency of elopements and abduction are gradually declining because of their sedentary life style. The practice of divorce, re-marriage and widow marriage are still existing. There is not much change in the observance of other rituals like, funeral rites, birth ceremonies. The Chenchus are experiencing a change in the observance of their rituals particularly with reference to the practice of marriage.     \n       7. Economy     \n       The Chenchus depend on the forest produce for their livelihood. They move in the dense forests in search of roots, fruits, and honey. They also collect leaves to manufacture leaf-plates and leaf-cups, which they sell to earn money. Hunting and gathering along with occasional fishing are found to be subsidies to their main source of livelihood. They hunt rabbit, wild boar, field rats, wild cock, and birds. Both sexes participate in hunting. Agriculture has been recently introduced among the Chenchus who are living in rural-urban set-up. Some of them possess agricultural lands in which they cultivate themselves. At present, most of the Chenchus are taking resort to manual labor and work under the forest and road contractors for a daily wage. Thus, both sexes are exposed to the outside world to earn their livelihood.            \n             8. Political Structure     \n       The Chenchu village forms an important unit in the socio-religious and economic activities of the Chenchu people. Traditionally, the social relations are regulated and stabilized by means of a council called Kulapanchayat. The village council consists of several elderly persons (Peddamanushulu) representing each clan of the village (gudem or penta). The council is headed by an elder person called Peddamanishi, generally from the dominant clan of the village, which is either determined by numerical strength or if the clan members happen to be the original settlers of the village. He is the person who looks after the welfare of the members. The members should follow the judgment or word pronounced by the head.      \n       9. Religious Beliefs        \n    Chenchus worship number of deities. They mainly believe in Bhagaban taru who lives in the sky and looks after the Chenchus in all their doings. Another deity they worship is Garelamai Sama, who is the Goddess of forest. She is believed to protect them from the danger, especially when they are in the jungle. Apart from these they pay homage to Potsamma- the God who cures the diseases like the small pox and Chicken pox. Gangamma, the deity of water, Mayasamma, the deity who protects the Chenchus from enemies are some of the other deities worshipped. Chenchus have also adopted certain religious practices from the Hindus.   \n         10. References    \n         Ayyappan A 1948.

The word ‘veddoid’ has come from the word “Vedda” which is the name of an ancient tribe in Srilanka. Like the “veddoids” the chenchus have curly hair, wide face, snubbed nose, long jaw and dark complexion and short stature. 5. Dress and OrnamentsThe Chenchus no longer wear just a loincloth. They now wear the dress and ornaments like other villagers and town people. 6. Social OrganisationThe Chenchu tribe is divided into four local groups such as:Konda Chenchu: They are found in Kurnool and Mahabubnagar districts;Koya Chenchu: They are found concentrating in Bhadrachalam district,            Ura Chenchu: They are scattered and distributed in towns and cities and live interspersed among advanced groups;            Dasari Chenchu: They are found mainly in Kurnool district.            These groups are principally endogamous units. But the Ura and Konda Chenchu, at present, have started marrying amongst themselves.                         6.1.  Clan            Each of the four groups is further divided into several patrilineal, totemic, and exogamous clans. Marriage within a clan is not permissible. Prof. Haimendorf has recorded as many as 26 clans among the Chenchus.            6.2. Family            Nuclear, monogamous families are common in all clans. Husband, wife, and unmarried children constitute as members in an average Chenchu family. Families are patrilocal in nature. Neolocal residence is common where married sons with their wives live in separate hutments within the domicile of their father’s. Father is the head of the family while mother enjoys her supremacy in domestic affairs.             6.3. Marriage            Traditionally, marriage by elopement or marriage by abduction was the common practices of marriage among the Chenchus. Divorces, widow marriage, remarriage were also common. Today the Chenchus prefer the arranged marriages. The frequency of elopements and abduction are gradually declining because of their sedentary life style. The practice of divorce, re-marriage and widow marriage are still existing. There is not much change in the observance of other rituals like, funeral rites, birth ceremonies. The Chenchus are experiencing a change in the observance of their rituals particularly with reference to the practice of marriage.            7. Economy            The Chenchus depend on the forest produce for their livelihood. They move in the dense forests in search of roots, fruits, and honey. They also collect leaves to manufacture leaf-plates and leaf-cups, which they sell to earn money. Hunting and gathering along with occasional fishing are found to be subsidies to their main source of livelihood. They hunt rabbit, wild boar, field rats, wild cock, and birds. Both sexes participate in hunting. Agriculture has been recently introduced among the Chenchus who are living in rural-urban set-up. Some of them possess agricultural lands in which they cultivate themselves. At present, most of the Chenchus are taking resort to manual labor and work under the forest and road contractors for a daily wage. Thus, both sexes are exposed to the outside world to earn their livelihood.                         8. Political Structure            The Chenchu village forms an important unit in the socio-religious and economic activities of the Chenchu people. Traditionally, the social relations are regulated and stabilized by means of a council called Kulapanchayat. The village council consists of several elderly persons (Peddamanushulu) representing each clan of the village (gudem or penta). The council is headed by an elder person called Peddamanishi, generally from the dominant clan of the village, which is either determined by numerical strength or if the clan members happen to be the original settlers of the village. He is the person who looks after the welfare of the members. The members should follow the judgment or word pronounced by the head.             9. Religious Beliefs            Chenchus worship number of deities. They mainly believe in Bhagaban taru who lives in the sky and looks after the Chenchus in all their doings. Another deity they worship is Garelamai Sama, who is the Goddess of forest. She is believed to protect them from the danger, especially when they are in the jungle. Apart from these they pay homage to Potsamma- the God who cures the diseases like the small pox and Chicken pox. Gangamma, the deity of water, Mayasamma, the deity who protects the Chenchus from enemies are some of the other deities worshipped. Chenchus have also adopted certain religious practices from the Hindus.            10. References             Ayyappan A 1948.

            tribeName: 'Gutob Gadaba',
            content: '1. Name and Synonym The name `Chenchu’ was explained based on ecological, racial, cultural, historical and mythological concepts. The interpretation on the basis of land and plants depicts that a person who lives under a ‘Chettu’ (tree) is known as Chenchu (Aiyappan:1948). According to Haimendorf (1943), the racial explanation for the word `Chenchu means curly hair, which is one of the physical features of the ‘Chenchus’. Manusmrithi makes a mention of, a people called ‘Chunchu’ and were assumed that the ‘Chunchu’ was nothing but a reference to the present day Chenchus. Aiyappan (1948) says that “the name ‘Chenchu’ may be derived from Chunchu meaning, forelocks”. Chenchus are also called as Chencholu, Chenchwar, Chenswar or Choncharu.2. Origins and HistoryThe origin of the Chenchus, is connected with the Lord Mallikarjuna of the Srisailam temple, who was the personification of the Lord Shiva. The story says that once their lived husband and wife in the small hut near the Srisailam temple. Both were very happy with their life, but they had no children. They paid homage at temples and worshiped many deities but all in vain. One day they went haunting into the forest. They found Lord Mallikarjuna in the forest and told him about their sorrow. Lord Mallikarjuna granted their wish on one condition that they would dedicate their child to him. Both agreed and after nine months, the women gave birth to the female child, whom she dedicated to the Lord Mallikarjuna. When the girl child was three years old, she left her parents and started living in the forests under the Chettu (tree). As she was living under the chettu tree she was called as the Chenchita. One day, while roaming in the jungle she met Lord Mallikarjuna and fell in love with him. He was also attracted to the girl and married her. The descendants are called Chenchus, which means children of the girl who was living under the cheetu (tree).3. Demography and Population DistributionThe Chenchus are one of the aboriginal tribes of the state of Andhra Pradesh in India. They are mostly confined to foothills and low-lying areas of Amarbad Plateau and Nallamalai hills in Kurnool, Mahaboobnagar, Prakasam, Rangareddy, Nalgonda and Guntur districts. As per the population censes taken in 2011, the population of Chenchus is 47,315. Among them 23,842 are men and 23,468 are women. Presently, the Chenchus live in permanent settlements known as gudems or Pentas comprising clusters of huts scattered over a wide area. 4. Physical FeaturesChenchus are short in height with long head, well-defined eyebrows with flat nose. They have jet-black curly hair and their complexion varies from wheat gray to brown. Chenchus have broad faces. The anthropologists observe that these chenchus have phsycal features similar to the “Veddoid” race. The word ‘veddoid’ has come from the word “Vedda” which is the name of an ancient tribe in Srilanka. Like the “veddoids” the chenchus have curly hair, wide face, snubbed nose, long jaw and dark complexion and short stature. 5. Dress and OrnamentsThe Chenchus no longer wear just a loincloth. They now wear the dress and ornaments like other villagers and town people. 6. Social OrganisationThe Chenchu tribe is divided into four local groups such as:Konda Chenchu: They are found in Kurnool and Mahabubnagar districts;Koya Chenchu: They are found concentrating in Bhadrachalam district,            Ura Chenchu: They are scattered and distributed in towns and cities and live interspersed among advanced groups;            Dasari Chenchu: They are found mainly in Kurnool district.            These groups are principally endogamous units. But the Ura and Konda Chenchu, at present, have started marrying amongst themselves.                         6.1.  Clan            Each of the four groups is further divided into several patrilineal, totemic, and exogamous clans. Marriage within a clan is not permissible. Prof. Haimendorf has recorded as many as 26 clans among the Chenchus.            6.2. Family            Nuclear, monogamous families are common in all clans. Husband, wife, and unmarried children constitute as members in an average Chenchu family. Families are patrilocal in nature.
